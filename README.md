**TvManiac** is a personalized entertainment tracking and recommendation Multiplatform app. By utilizing
[TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs), we can view shows, create a watchlist get statistics, and much more. This project aims to
demonstrate KMP development capabilities. This is currently running on:

- Android: Compose
- iOS: SwiftUI

## ðŸš§ Under Heavy Development ðŸš§

This is my playground for learning Kotlin Multiplatform. With that said, I'm sure it's filled with bugs crawling everywhere, and I'm
probably doing a couple of things wrong. So a lot is changing, but that shouldn't stop you from checking it out.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To fetch data, you will need to [create a TMDB API app](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate an API key if you don't have
> one. Each platform has its own resource key file:
>
> - **Android**: Add your API keys to `core/util/src/androidMain/resources/dev.yaml`
> - **iOS**: Add your API keys to `ios/ios/Resources/dev.yaml`
>
> In both files, replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.

## ðŸ–¥ Project Setup & Environment

#### Requirements

- [Zulu Java 21](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu)
- You require the latest [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) release to be able to build the app.
- Install KMM Plugin. Checkout [this setup guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-setup.html).

### Opening iOS Project

- Navigate to the ios directory & open `.xcodeproj`

### Git Hooks

The project uses Git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits. To install the hooks, run:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

This will install the following hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs code formatting checks using Spotless before allowing a commit. If the checks fail, the commit
  will be aborted.

## Architecture Overview

- [ ] TODO: Add detail architecture

![TvManiac Architecture](https://github.com/thomaskioko/tv-maniac/assets/841885/84e314fc-71a5-40e5-b034-213e6b546f9a)

## Gradle Convention Plugins

The project uses custom Gradle convention plugins to maintain consistent build configurations across modules. These plugins help standardize dependencies,
compiler settings, and build logic throughout the codebase. For an in-depth guide on how these convention plugins are created, structured, and published to Maven Central,
check out the article: [Publishing Gradle Convention Plugins](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/publishing_gradle_plugins/).
